### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation
- **Description**: Implement **2FA login security** using SMS-based authentication or an app like Google Authenticator.
- **Skills Required**: Web development, OAuth, cryptography.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Blockchain-Based Security System
- **Description**: Develop a **decentralized security system** using blockchain for access control, logs, or secure data sharing.
- **Skills Required**: Blockchain fundamentals, smart contracts, cryptography.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Zero Trust Architecture Implementation
- **Description**: Implement **Zero Trust Security** in a test environment by enforcing **identity verification, micro-segmentation, and least-privilege access**.
- **Skills Required**: Networking, cloud security, advanced security principles.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Secure File Sharing Application
- **Description**: Develop an **end-to-end encrypted** file-sharing system with digital signatures for data integrity.
